Squabble is a comment server built on Lumen, using a SQLite backend for storing comment data.

It is built for use on http://savaslabs.com although you could easily adapt it for your own site, with a bit of time and server to spare.

### Installation for local development

Copy `docker-compose.local.example.yml` to `docker-compose.local.yml`. Add overrides for any environment variables which you need to override by copying the defaults set in `docker-compose.yml` and changing them in your local configuration file.

Run `make build` to rebuild the container if you've made any changes to `Dockerfile` or the files in the `docker` directory.

Run `make install`

#### Local development

Run `make up`.

Edit your `/etc/hosts` and set `127.0.0.1 local.comments.savaslabs.com`. Run `curl http://local.comments.savaslabs.com/api/comments` to confirm that the server is working; if not, run `docker-compose logs -f` to see what error messages are appearing.

(Run `make help` to display a summary list of the most commonly used commands)

#### Testing

`make test` will run PHPUnit and Behat tests.
